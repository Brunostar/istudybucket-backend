<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great platforms for social interaction and communication in the world. None of which really targets the needs of student in this exponentially growing digital age.


Here's why:
* Your time online should be invested in interacting with individuals who can help with your study issues or hooks you can't seem to set loose in school.
* You shouldn't be stressing yourself with a problem when there is someone a few kilobytes of data access away from you who can solve it.
* You should have an excuse for while you are online while studying :smile:

iStudyBucket comes as a solution to this issue and this project focuses on the services which will consume requests from our mobile and web applications.

A list of commonly used resources that we find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
